# Generic GDS utility

The utility is developed by Albert Li since 1996.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this Generic GDS utility is to convert binary GDS-II file
to a readable text format (GDT), so user can validate the design content,
modify or manipulate the content using simple script language such as tcl or perl
without decoding the GDS-II binary format.

## Building

build/test:

```bash
make
```

clean:

```bash

```
